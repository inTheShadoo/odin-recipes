        Description:
    </h3>
    <p>
        Chocolate cake or chocolate gâteau 
        is a cake flavored with melted chocolate, cocoa powder, or both.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chocolate flavour oozes all through this cake even though it’s only made with cocoa powder,
        like our very own Fudgy Chocolate Cake. With a crumb so incredibly tender, this cake stays moist for a good 4-5 days.
        Whether you eat it plain, dust it with powdered sugar or serve with dollops of cream or scoops of ice cream, it truly is perfectly perfect!
    </p>
    <h3>

        <li>125g Tararua Butter</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Chelsea Golden Syrup</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Meadow Fresh Original Milk</li>
        <li>2 tsp Edmonds Baking Soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla essence</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Icing Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Chelsea Icing Sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp cocoa powder</li>
        <li>50g Tararua Butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Steps:
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180°C bake. Grease and line a high-sided 20cm round cake tin.</li>
        <li>Mix together the Edmonds Standard Grade Flour, cocoa, Edmonds Baking Powder and Chelsea White Sugar. </li>
        <li>In separate bowl, melt the Tararua Butter and Chelsea Golden Syrup together (about 1 minute on high in the microwave usually does it). </li>
        <li>In another bowl whisk the eggs, then whisk in the Meadow Fresh Original Milk, Edmonds Baking Soda and vanilla. Add both the butter mix and the egg/milk mix to dry ingredients and beat on medium for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Spoon into prepared tin and level the surface. Bake for 50-60 minutes, until the top of the cake bounces back when lightly pressed and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool in tin for 10-15 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. </li>
        <li>for the Icing:Place all icing ingredients in a medium bowl. Beat on low to combine, then increase speed to high and beat until smooth and creamy. Spread onto cooled cake.</li>
    </ol>
